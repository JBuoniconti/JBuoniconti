<h2>Summary</h2>
From a very young age, I have developed a strong passion for writing creatively and telling narratives that are often ignored. This has prompted me to pursue a degree in both English and Journalism; inspiring me to portray people’s stories through a unique lens, which I hope to channel through a career in both Journalism and publishing.
